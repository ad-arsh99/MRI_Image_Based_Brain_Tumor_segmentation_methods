gui_images.m file with Matlab.

Step-5) Click on the run option present in the editor menu.

Step-6) A GUI window shall pop up showing you the different stages involved in the Tumor Detection.

Step-7) Click on "Load Input MRI image" button and select an image from brain_tumor_dataset
folder present in our project folder.

Step-8) Click on the "Gray scale MRI image button" to get the respective output at that stage.

Step-9) Click on the "High Pass filtered Image" to get its respective output at that stage.

Step-10) Click on the "Median filtered Image" to get its respective output at that stage.

Step-11) Click on the "Threshold Image" to get its respective output at that stage.

Step-12) Click on the "Edges using Sobel Filter" to get its respective output at that stage.

Step-13) Click on the "Watershed Segmented Image using Sobel" to get its respective output at that stage.

Step-14) Click on the "Edges using Canny Edge" to get its respective output at that stage.

Step-15) Click on the "Extracted Tumor" to get the final image of the segmented tumor.

After clicking all the buttons, you can see the GUI window filled with outputs present across
